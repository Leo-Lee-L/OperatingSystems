                    Shadow Page Tables
                </summary>
    
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The problem is that each guest OS thinks it is "president
                        of the university," and can map virtual pages to real pages
                        as it wishes to.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        But it isn't president: the hypervisor is. And some other
                        guest OS may be using those physical pages already.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Solution:</b> a <b>shadow page table</b>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The hypervisor traps on the sensitive instruction that
                        loads a hardware register to point to the page tables.
                        (On a type 1 hypervisor with VT.) It maps the guest OS
                        virtual pages to their <i>real</i> hardware addresses.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        But the hypervisor will need to update the shadow page
                        table every time the guest OS page tables update. How?
                        The guest OS just writes to memory to update these: no
                        sensitive instruction is used.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    Page Faults
                </summary>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Two possible ways to handle this:
                        <br />
                        1) Make the guest OS page tables read-only, 
                        so any attempt to access them creates a page fault.
                        <br />
                        2) Let the guest OS modify its page tables at will:
                        then attempts to access those pages will create page
                        faults.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Both methods will create lots of... page faults!
                        <br />
                        And page faults are expensive.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We distinguish two types of page faults:
                        <br />
                        1) <b>guest-induced page faults</b>, which involve
                        pages actually swapped out of RAM; and
                        <br />
                        2) <b>hypervisor-induced page faults</b>, which occur
                        in order to keep the shadow page table up to date.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Page faults are extra expensive in virtualized
                        environments, because they lead to <b>VM exits</b>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In a VM exit, the hypervisor regains control. This
                        involves saving and restoring lots of state, and may
                        tens of thousands of cycles.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        With paravirtualization, the situation is different.
                        The guest OS knows it is virtualized, and knows to
                        notify the hypervisor when its page tables have been
                        updated.

                        There is now hardware support for <b>nested page

                        between virtual pages and physical pages. Nested page
                        tables simply extend that scheme so that we can have
                        several layers of mapping.
