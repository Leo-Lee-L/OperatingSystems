            Scenario: a type 1 hypervisor is running a guest OS that thinks it
            is the kernel, but really is in user mode.
            The guest runs in <b>virtual kernel mode</b>. Its
            apps think they are in user mode (and really are).
            <br />
            <br />
            What happens when the guest executes a privileged instruction?
            Normally, this would cause the program to crash. But with VT, the
            instruction traps to the hypervisor, and the hypervisor determines
            if the guest OS called it -- OK! -- or a guest application did --
            not OK!
            </p>

                    So how was this handled before VT was available?
