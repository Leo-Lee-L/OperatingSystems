                We can use the CPU while RAM, disk, and network access are
                occurring.

                Two types of parallelism:
                <br>
                <b>Pseudo-parallelism:</b> on one CPU, gives the appearance that
                processes are running simultaneously.
                <br>
                <b>Real parallelism:</b> with multiple CPUs, processes
                <i>do</i> run simultaneously. (But not <i>all</i> of them,
                usually: e.g., four CPUs on my Mac, but 392 processes.)

                    The illusion of parallelism is produced by continually
                    switching the CPU between processes. These switches are
                    expensive.

                    <br>
                    there is no real difference conceptually between what a
                    single CPU running 100 processes does been a four core CPU
                    running 400 processes. So here we will just look at the
                    single CPU situation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It is important to know that from the point of view of a
                    single program, multiprocessing renders the behavior of the
                    program nondeterministic. The program cannot be certain how
                    frequently it will get the CPU. This can become crucial
                    with programs doing things like playing a video, and
                    really, really crucial, if the program is monitoring the
                    state of a nuclear power plant or a patient's vital signs
                    in the hospital.

                    A process is a program <i>in action</i>.

            <h2>
                Process Creation
            </h2>

                <p>
                    How processes are created:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>System initialization
                    <li>A running process executes a process-creation system
                        call.
                    <li>A user requests a new process.
                    <li>A batch job starts.
                </ol>

                <p>
                    Technically, in <b>all</b> cases, 2 is how new processes
                    are created.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At boot time, a windowing system or command shell may be
                    started. But the system also starts daemons that listen on
                    ports for mail or web page requests, scan for viruses,
                    handle print requests, etc.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The book claims that the batch situation only applies on
                    mainframes. But UNIX has a <b>cron</b> facility for running batch
                    jobs, and Windows has a <b>Task Scheduler</b>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>UNIX:</b> <b>fork</b> and <b>exec</b> pair start process. After fork,
                    the child is a copy of the parent. It can then manipulate
                    file handles, and then exec a new program in its process
                    space.
                    <br>
                    <b>Windows:</b> <b>CreateProcess</b> is the single call that
                    accomplishes both of the above tasks. Win32 has 100 other
                    calls for managing processes.

            <h2>
                Process Termination
            </h2>

                <p>
                    How processes terminate:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Normal exit (voluntary)
                    <li>Error exit (voluntary)
                    <li>Fatal error exit (involuntary)
                    <li>Killed by another (involuntary)
                </ol>

                <p>
                    Very often, a process and because it has finished its work.
                    The user clicks "Exit" on a word processor, or a compiler
                    finishes compiling a program. In UNIX, the process executes
                    the <b>exit</b> system call, and on Windows,
                    <b>ExitProcess</b>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The second case is really a special instance of the first:
                    if we try to compile foo.c and no such file exists, the
                    compiler exits with the complaint "No such file." but it
                    may set a different exit code.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the third case, the process has done something naughty,
                    and the OS kills it: it tried an illegal instruction (e.g.,
                    switching into kernel mode without executing a system call)
                    or accessed memory not its own, or dividing by zero.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The fourth case is when one process kills another with a
                    system call and process ID. In UNIX, the call is
                    <b>kill</b>, and in Windows, <b>TerminateProcess</b>. In
                    neither case does this kill processes created by the murder
                    victim. (In some OSes it will.) The murderer needs the
                    right permissions, e.g., a user process can't kill a kernel
                    process, and a (non-root) user can't kill the process of
                    another user.

                <p>
                    UNIX processes form a hierarchy: a parent spwans child
                    processes, which spawn grandchild processes, etc. For
                    instance, a signal may be sent to the whole process group.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Windows has no such process hierarchy.

                    We look at CPU usage from a probabilistic viewpoint, and
                    try to see what the <i>likely</i> rate of CPU usage is. We
                    get a formula, where <i>p</i> is the fraction of time an
                    average process waits for I/O, and <i>n</i> is the number
                    of processes:
