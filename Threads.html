                    Why threads?
                </p>

                    <li>Many programs consist of multiple activities that could
                    go on "at once."

                        <li>User interface
                        <li>Disk I/O

                    Thread scenario: user changes sentence one of an 800-page
                    book, then goes to make a second change. A singl-threaded
                    program must re-format the whole book, and then return
                    control to the user. With two threads, one formats and the
                    other handles user input. We can add a third-thread to
                    handle disk I/O.
                    <br>
                    Processes won't do here: they can't share the memory
                    containing the document.

                    Situation is tricky: think of all those times you have
                    clicked on the wrong link, because the mouse was live.

            <h2>
                The Classical Thread Model
            </h2>

                <p>
                    Process as group of resources versus process as thread of
                    execution.
                    <br>
                    Threads separate the latter from the former.
                    <br>
                    An analogy: we have theaters (resources) and in them we put
                    on plays (threads). In the process-only model, each play
                    gets its own theater. With threads, several plays can run
                    "at once" in a single theater, sharing lights, props,
                    ticket booths, etc.
