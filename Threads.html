                    Thread scenario: user changes sentence one of an 800-page
                    book, then goes to make a second change. A singl-threaded
                    program must re-format the whole book, and then return
                    control to the user. With two threads, one formats and the
                    other handles user input. We can add a third-thread to
                    handle disk I/O.
                    <br>
                    Processes won't do here: they can't share the memory
                    containing the document.

                <p>
                    Process as group of resources versus process as thread of
                    execution.
                    <br>
                    Threads separate the latter from the former.
                    <br>
                    An analogy: we have theaters (resources) and in them we put
                    on plays (threads). In the process-only model, each play
                    gets its own theater. With threads, several plays can run
                    "at once" in a single theater, sharing lights, props,
                    ticket booths, etc.

                    The programmer can put some threads in kernel space, and
                    some in user space.

                <p>
                    Also tries to be the best of both worlds: here, the kernel
                    makes a call (<i>upcall</i>)
                    into user space to tell the user code that a thread has blocked.

                    <b>Objection:</b> Calls are supposed to go in the opposite

                <p>
                    Imagine a web server, waiting for HTTP requests.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Usual approach:</b> Have a process or a thread blocking,
                    waiting for a request to come in.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Pop-up approach:</b> create a thread at the moment a
                    request arrives: the thread "pops up" Justin Handel the
                    request.
                    <br>
                    These can take over quickly, since they have no state to
                    restore.
