            </h2>

                <p>
                    Three major issues:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>How do processes communicate at all? (They live in
                        separate address spaces.)
                    <li>How can they avoid stepping on each other's toes?
                    <li>How to get the order right when processes depend upon
                        each other? (E.g., one process produces data that
                        another one uses to do calculations.)
                </ol>

                <p>
                    <b>Note:</b> Two and three apply to threads just as much as
                    to processes! Number one doesn't, since threads share memory.

            <h2>
                Race Conditions
            </h2>

                <p>
                    Picture a single-user bathroom with a door
                    on its north side and a door
                    on its south side. You want to enter by the north door,
                    while someone else wants to enter by the south one. You
                    both knock: no one answers. 
                    <br>
                    So you both enter.
                    <br>
                    <b>Oops!</b> Embarrasment.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But in the case of processes, the result can be worse. Two
                    processes check to see if there is a seat left on a flight
                    to London. There is... <b>one</b> seat left. Both processes
                    get told "Yes." And now they each assign the seat... to
                    different passengers.
                    <br>
                    <b>Oops!</b> One of them is going to have to be given a lot
                    of bonus miles to give up their seat.
                    <br>
                    And this can get even worse: imagine the code is
                    determining if it is safe to place more uranium in the core
                    of a nuclear power plant, and two processes both get told
                    it is safe two put in one more unit... so they <b>both</b>
                    put in one more unit... and we have a terrible disaster.
                    <br>
                    This is not a mere hypothetical... race conditions in the

                <h3>
                    Disabling Interrupts
                </h3>

                    <p>
                        The CPU only switches among processes when an 
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt">
                            interrupt
                        </a>
                        occurs. Therefore, if a process disables interrupts
                        upon entering a critical region, there is no danger
                        another process can interfere with what it is up to.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But what if a user process turns off interrupts, and
                        never turns them on again? The system is now dead!
                        <br>
                        Also, on a multi-CPU system, disabling interrupts only
                        affects one CPU: other CPUs can still access shared
                        memory.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On the other hand, it may be useful for the
                        <i>kernel</i> to disable interrupts: if it is updating
                        a critical table, it may be important that no process
                        can interrupt the update.
                        <br>
                        <b>So:</b> Disabling interrupts is OK inside the
                        kernel, but is not a useful way for user processes to
                        avoid race conditions.

                <h3>
                    Lock Variables
                </h3>

                    <p>
                        Let's go back to the bathroom example to understand the
                        lock variable solution. This is like having the bathroom
                        doors bear a little sign that says in use. The person
                        who wants to use the restroom checks to see if the sign
                        says "in use." If it does not, the person enters the
                        room, And then sets the sign by locking both doors.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        However, this does not solve the problem: both people
                        can show up, won at the south door and one at the north
                        door, both find the sign says "Vacant," and both enter
                        the room.
                    </p>


                <h3>
                    Strict Alternation

                    <p>
                        <b>Busy waiting:</b> Continually testing some condition
                        until it says "go ahead". Not very efficient.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Strict alternation violates condition three of our
                        desired conditions above: is the turn of process X to
                        enter its critical region, but it doesn't need to enter
                        that region at the moment, it nevertheless blocks
                        processes Y and Z entering their critical region.
                        <br>
                        Bathroom analogy: it is as though you can't go to the
                        bathroom when it is someone else's turn, <i>even if
                        they don't need the bathroom!</i>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A lock using busy waiting is called a <b>spin lock</b>.

                    <p>
                        Peterson's ingenious solution is to combine the turn
                        idea with the idea of "being interested": so you go to
                        use the loo (British for restroom). You register that
                        you are interested, and then set <i>turn</i> to you.
                        Whoever sets <i>turn</i> last wins, and gets to go in.
                        But if no one else is interested, you always get to
                        "go."

                    <p>
                        This solution solves the race condition problem by
                        creating a new, atomic instruction, <b>TSL</b> (test
                        and set lock), that means a process checking to see if
                        the bathroom is free can also set a lock on the door in
                        an uninterruptible operation.

                        <br>
                        <b>Crucial point:</b> All solutions depending upon
                        calls to <i>enter_region</i> and <i>leave_region</i>
                        depend upon processes not cheating and simply entering
                        their critical region without making the proper calls!

                    A problem with Peterson, TCL, and XCHG: they all involve

                    <br>
                    Bathroom analogy: you stand at the bathroom door,

                    <br>
                    This not only wastes CPU time, but can create <b>priority
                    inversion problems</b>: a high-priority process is
                    looping, waiting to enter its critical region, and a low-
                    priority process is ready to leave its critical region.
                    But the high-priority process never yields to the lower
                    one, and so it loops forever!

                        <b>The situation:</b> Once process listens on a socket

                        removing them from the buffer.

                    <p>
                        We can still get race conditions with these calls: the
                        consumer could check the number of items in the buffer
                        and finds it to be 0, but before it can go to sleep, the
                        producer is scheduled, and begins filling the buffer.
                        The producer repeatedly calls <b>wakeup</b> on the
                        consumer, but the consumer has not gone to sleep!
                        Finally, the producer fills the buffer, and goes to
                        sleep. The consumer is activated, finds the buffer size
                        (it held from long ago) is 0, and goes to sleep.

                    The key to semaphores is that they are implemented as

                        Here is the Tanenbaum-Bos code for solving the

                <p>
                    Monitors are a feature of a programming language created to
                    make synchronization easier. Languages with monitors
                    include Java, C#, Visual Basic, and Ada.

                    <br>
                    Below is code showing the use of monitors in Java: it is
                    the <b>synchronized</b> keyword that creates the monitor.

                            try {
                                wait();    // block until signaled (notify)
