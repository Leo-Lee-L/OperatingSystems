            <h2>
                Overview
            </h2>

                <p>
                    Three major issues:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>How do processes communicate at all? (They live in
                        separate address spaces.)
                    <li>How can they avoid stepping on each other's toes?
                    <li>How to get the order right when processes depend upon
                        each other? (E.g., one process produces data that
                        another one uses to do calculations.)
                </ol>

                <p>
                    <b>Note:</b> Two and three apply to threads just as much as
                    to processes! Number one doesn't, since threads share memory.
                </p>

            <h2>
                Race Conditions
            </h2>

                <p>
                    Picture a single-user bathroom with a door
                    on its north side and a door
                    on its south side. You want to enter by the north door,
                    while someone else wants to enter by the south one. You
                    both knock: no one answers. 
                    <br>
                    So you both enter.
                    <br>
                    <b>Oops!</b> Embarrasment.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But in the case of processes, the result can be worse. Two
                    processes check to see if there is a seat left on a flight
                    to London. There is... <b>one</b> seat left. Both processes
                    get told "Yes." And now they each assign the seat... to
                    different passengers.
                    <br>
                    <b>Oops!</b> One of them is going to have to be given a lot
                    of bonus miles to give up their seat.
                    <br>
                    And this can get even worse: imagine the code is
                    determining if it is safe to place more uranium in the core
                    of a nuclear power plant, and two processes both get told
                    it is safe two put in one more unit... so they <b>both</b>
                    put in one more unit... and we have a terrible disaster.
                    <br>
                    This is not a mere hypothetical... race conditions in the

                    <b>Race conditions</b>
                    are made only more prevalent by multi-core CPUs, since
                    more processes are actually running at once.

                <h3>
                    Disabling Interrupts
                </h3>

                    <p>
                        The CPU only switches among processes when an 
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt">
                            interrupt
                        </a>
                        occurs. Therefore, if a process disables interrupts
                        upon entering a critical region, there is no danger
                        another process can interfere with what it is up to.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But what if a user process turns off interrupts, and
                        never turns them on again? The system is now dead!
                        <br>
                        Also, on a multi-CPU system, disabling interrupts only
                        affects one CPU: other CPUs can still access shared
                        memory.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On the other hand, it may be useful for the
                        <i>kernel</i> to disable interrupts: if it is updating
                        a critical table, it may be important that no process
                        can interrupt the update.
                        <br>
                        <b>So:</b> Disabling interrupts is OK inside the
                        kernel, but is not a useful way for user processes to
                        avoid race conditions.
