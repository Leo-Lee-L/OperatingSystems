				A resource is anything that must be acquired, used and released over the course of time. Resources are of two types:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Preemptable: It is the type of resource which can be taken away from the process owning it with no ill effects
					</li>
					<li>
						Nonpreemptable: It is the type of resource that cannot be taken away from its current owner without potentially causing failure.  
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
				<br/>
				In general deadlocks involve nonpreemptable resources. Potential deadlocks that involve preemptable resources can usually be resolved by reallocating the resources
				from one process to another. <br/>
				Sequence of events required to use a resource:
				<ul>
					<ul>
						<li> Request the resource </li>
						<li> Use the Resource </li>
						<li> Release the resource </li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				</p>
