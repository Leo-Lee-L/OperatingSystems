				Files are logical units of information created by 
                processes and are managed by the operating systems.
            The part of the opearting system dealing with files is known as 
                the
				<b>file system</b>.

            <br/>
            <h3>
                 File Naming
            </h3>
			<p>
				When a process creates a file it gives the file a name, 
                and even after this process terminates the file 
                continues to exist and can be accessed by other processes by its 
				name.<br/> 
				The exact rules for file naming might vary from one system to another 
                but almost all operating systems allow strings of one to 
                eight characters along with special characters
				like underscore.<br/>
				The file naming as two parts which are seperated by a period.
                The name of the file after the period is called the 
                <b>file extension</b> which indicates something about the file.

			<h3>
				File Structure
			</h3>
			<figure>
			<img src="graphics/FileStruct.png" height="350" width="480">
			</figure>
			<p>
				There are three common ways for structuring of files
				<ul>
					<li>Byte Sequence (unstructured sequence of bytes)</li> 
					<li>Record Sequence </li>
					<li>Tree </li>
				</ul>
				<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b> Byte Sequence:</b>
                In this way of structuring, a file is an unstructured sequence of bytes.
                What is contained inside the file is specific to the program that
                will write / read them.
				<br/>
				<b> Record Sequence:</b>
                In this structuring, a file is a sequence of 
                fixed-length records, each with some internal structure.

				<br/>
				<b> Tree:</b>
                In this organization, a file consists of a tree of records, 
                not necessarily all the same length, each containing a key 
                field in a fixed position in the record.
                The tree is sorted on the key field, to allow rapid 
                searching for a particular key. All the basic operations are 
                performed using the key value.
                This type of file is clearly quite different from the 
                unstructured byte streams used in UNIX and Windows 
                and is used on some large mainframe computers for
					commercial data processing.
                <br>
                Databases such as Oracle creates files that are like this,
                without relying on the OS to know the format.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h3>
				File Types
			</h3>
			<p>
				UNIX and Windows operating systems have regular files and directories.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<b> Regular files:</b> Files containing user information. (This
                is how the book puts it, but these may also contain system
                info, such as /etc/passwd.)
				<br/>
				<b> Directories:</b>
                These are the system files for maintaining the structure of file system.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				UNIX also has two other types of files:
				<br/>
				<b> Character-special files:</b>
                These files are related to input and output operations.
                They are used to model serial I/O devices, such as terminals, 
                printers, and networks. 
				<br/>
				<b> Block-special files:</b>
                These files are used to model disks.
			</p>
			<p>
				Regular files are generally ASCII or binary files:
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<b> ASCII files:</b>
                Files containing lines of text.
                These files can be displayed and printed as is, and 
                 they can be edited with any text editor.
				<br/>
                They can be used in pipelines, processed by scripts, etc.
				<br/>
				<b> Binary Files:</b>
                These files are not human readable.
                <br>
                <b>Executable binary files:</b>
                The operating system will execute an executable 
                binary file only if it has the proper format.
                Format of an executable file has 5 sections:
            </p>
                <ol>
                    <li> Header
                    <li>Text
                    <li>Data
                    <li>Relocation bits
                    <li>Symbol table
                </ol>
            <p>
                Header section indicates that the binary file is executable,
                and contains other info about the program.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Archive:</b>
            It consists of a collection of library procedures compiled but not linked.
            Each one is prefaced by a header telling its name, creation date, owner,
					protection code, and size.

			<h3>
				File Access
			</h3>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li> Sequential Access:
                        Earlier operating systems provided only 
                        one kind of file access called sequential file 
                        access in which a process could read all the bytes or 
						 records in a file in a order.
                        Sequential files were convenient when 
                        the storage medium was magnetic tape rather than disk. 
                    </li>
					<li> Random Access:
                        Using disks it is possible to read the bytes or 
                        records of a file out of order making use of the Key value.
                        Processes that can read a file in a random order
						 is termed as random access and the file 
                         read in this manner is called as a random-access file.

						 Methods used for specifying where to start 
                         reading from in a random access file are 
                         <b>read</b> operation and <b>seek</b> operation.

					</li>
				</ul>
				
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h3>
				File Attributes
			</h3>
			<p>
				Operating systems associate other information related to 
                iles such as date and time when a file was created, 
                ermissions for the file access as <b>file attributes</b>.
				These attributes are also called <b>metadata</b>.
                The list of attributes considerably vary from system to system.

			</p>
			<p>
			Some file attributes:
			<br/>
			<div align="center">
			<table>
			<tr>
				<th><b> Attribute </b></th>
				<th><b> Meaning </b></th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Protection</td>
				<td>Who can access the file and in what way</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Read-only flag</td>
				<td>0 for read/write; 1 for read only</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Creation time</td>
				<td>Date and time the file was created</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Time of last change</td>
				<td>Date and time the file was last changed</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Current size</td>
				<td>Number of bytes in the file</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Owner</td>
				<td>Current owner</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Key Length</td>
				<td>Number of bytes in the key field</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Temporary flag</td>
				<td>0 for normal; 1 for delete file on process exit</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Password</td>
				<td>Password needed to access the file</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			</div>
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h3>
				File Operations
			</h3>
			<p>
				Files exist to store information and allow it to be retrieved later.
                Different systems provide different operations to 
                allow storage and retrieval. 
				Some of the Operations are listed below.
				<ul>
					<li>Create</li>
					<li>Delete</li>
					<li>Open</li>
					<li>Close</li>
					<li>Read</li>
					<li>Write</li>
					<li>Append: This call is a restricted form of wr ite.
                    It can add data only to the end of the file.</li>
					<li>Seek: This that repositions the file pointer to a 
                        specific place in the file</li>
					<li>Get Attributes - Processes often need to read file 
                        attributes to do their work.</li>
					<li>Set Attributes - Some of the attributes are user 
                        settable and can be changed after the 
                        file has been created and this system call 
                        can be used for the same.</li>
					<li>Rename - This system call is used to 
                        change the name of the file.</li>
				</ul>
