                    Hypervisors need to score well on
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Safety:</b>
                        the hypervisor
                        has full control of the virtualized resources.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Fidelity:</b>
                        the behavior of a program running on the virtual
                        machine should be the same as if it were running on the
                        machine being imitated.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Efficiency:</b>
                        as much code as possible should run without
                        intervention by the hypervisor.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <br />
                
                <p>
                    An <b>interpreter</b> can be safe and faithful, but
                    performance will be bad.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Sensitive instructions</b>:
                    behave differently if executed in kernel mode than when
                    executed in user mode.
                    <br />
                    <b>Privileged instructions</b>:
                    trap if executed in user mode.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Popek and Goldberg showed that a machine is virtualizable
                    only if the sensitive instructions are a subset of the
                    privileged instructions.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The Intel family did not have this property until 2005.
                    Also, user mode programs could read senstive info, like
                    whether they were in user mode. (We don't want the guest OS
                    doing this.)
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    What we need is <b>trap-and-emulate</b>.
                </p>

                <p>
                So how <i>were</i> hypervisors possible before 2005?!
                Answer: <b>binary translation</b>.
                </p>

                <p>
                Another approach: <b>paravirtualization</b>.
                Here, the host presents a "machine-like" software interface
                that allows the guest to make <b>hypercalls</b>.
                <br />
                <br />
                Drawback: the guest has to be aware it is running on a VM,
                since it has to make the hypercalls.
