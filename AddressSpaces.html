                <ul>
                    <li>
                    The traditional approach of exposing physical
                    memory to processes has several drawbacks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    As the operating system is by itself a process,
                    another process can trash the operating system by
                    causing inconsistencies in main memory
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Also, multiprogramming is a common trend
                    nowadays and as a result, having processes
                    access physical memory is dangerous.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    A solution is, to use abstract memory, i.e
                    for each process to have  a notion of its
                    own address space.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Each process has its own address space,
                    independent of those belonging to other processes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    The address perceived by the process is called
                    logical memory address, this is different
                    from actual physical memory location.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    A separate hardware is responsible for
                    converting logical addresses to physical
                    addresses every time
                    the process reads or writes from and to memory.

                Memory Management Techniques
            </summary>


            <p>
                There is rarely enough memory to actively hold all code
                and data structures needed by running processes in memory
                at any given point of time.
                The idea is to swap in and out blocks of code as they are
                required from secondary memory.

                    <b>Fixed Partitioning</b> <br>
                        Main memory is divided into static partitions.
                        Any process, given its requirements may be loaded into a
                        partition of equal or greater size. <br>
                        Note that here processes are not divided into modules,
                        rather memory is divided and entire processes are placed
                        inside a partition.<br><br>

                        Partitions may be of two types :
                </p>
                    <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Equal Sized</b><br>
                        If program size is beyond that of the partition size,
                        need overlays
                        <br>
                        Gives rise to internal fragmentation
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Unequal Sized</b><br>
                        Fit into smallest possible partition
                    </li>
                    </ol>

                <p>
                <br>
                <b>Dynamic Partitioning</b>  <br>
                    <br>
                        Here, partitions are created dynamically as
                        per the requirement/size of the process in question.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Partition created to be exact fit for asking
                        process size. No Internal fragmentation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When processes are pulled out, it creates
                        holes in memory space. This causes external fragmentation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Need to perform a process known as compaction to regularly
                        shift partitions and remove holes created by processes leaving
                        main memory. This is a costly process and 
                        cannot be done repeatedly.

                        Main memory is divided into equal sized partitions.
                        Each partition is called a <b>frame</b>.

                    <li>
                        To load a process, all of its pages are loaded
                        into frames which need not be contagious.
                        The OS takes care of the order of execution.

                    <li>
                        Operating System maintains a page table for each process
                        which contains the frame location for each page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Paging causes zero internal fragmentation and
                        is optimal among static partitioning techniques.

                    <li>

                            matching the size of each segment.
                            This creates an exact fit for every segment.
