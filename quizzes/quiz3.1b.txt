Programming with multiple threads is of limited use to provide parallelism with
no memory abstraction because,^It does not allow multiple programs to run at
the same time, It is a cause for race conditions, Concurrent Programming is
difficult,There is no way for multithreading to work without memory
abstraction 
Without memory abstraction we can still have multiprogramming,^by only running one program at a time and completely swapping each successive program in and out of memory,by using VT,by taking advantage of an MMU,with paging
Even without swapping or memory abstraction we can multiprogram,if we write our code very carefully,if we have an MMU,^if we have special hardware to divide memory between different programs,all of the above
