A key attribute of an ideal virtual machine would be, it runs as fast as the real machine, it runs just like the real machine, it is completely isolated from other VMs,^all of the above.
Live migrating a VM between physical devices requires coordination of, the file system and the stack pointer,^the CPU scheduler the memory manager and the network stack, the RAID array, the number of applications running on each VM.
A motivation for VMware was,the desire to copy IBM,the need for a research grant,the fact that no one had ever created a VM before,^the difficulty in innovating in complex modern operatings systems.
One factor making VMs easier to implement on mainframes than on PCs was,^vertical integration in the mainframe world,Microsoft's opposition to virtualization,the complexity of mainframe design,the lack of UNIX versions on PCs
