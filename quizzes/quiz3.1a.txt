IBM 360 provided multiprogramming without abstraction or swapping  by,
Magic,^using a technique called static relocation, using segmentation,
providing pseudo-parallelism the same was an operating system running on a
single core cpu  
Without memory abstraction we can still have multiprogramming,^by only running one program at a time and completely swapping each successive program in and out of memory,by using VT,by taking advantage of an MMU,with paging
Even without swapping or memory abstraction we can multiprogram,if we write our code very carefully,if we have an MMU,^if we have special hardware to divide memory between different programs,all of the above
