                    <li>
                        The guest OS will begin by probing for hardware
                        devices.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What should the hypervisor do?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        One approach: respond with a list of the actual
                        hardware devices.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Guest OS attempts to write to the device registers will
                        then trap (they are sensitive instructions), and the
                        hypervisor can then do whatever is needed, perhaps just
                        really write to those registers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        But the hypervisor can also "fake" devices: pretend to
                        have an old device when a fancy new one has been
                        installed. This allows device upgrades to be invisible
                        to the guests.

                    <li>
                        The problem: DMA. DMA hardware is trying to directly
                        access memory. This memory must be re-mapped for VMs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>I/O MMU</b> (memory management unit): virtualizes
                        I/O the same way an MMU virtualizes memory.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The I/O MMU eliminates the DMA problem. It maps device
                        memory addresses to real physical addresses. It can
                        keep different guests DMA out of each other's way.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Device pass through</b> allows both the device and
                        the guest OS to be unaware that any address translation
                        may be going on: both think they are directly
                        addressing the same memory locations. It is useful when
                        sharing a device between VMs is not feasible .

                        other guests.

                        <br />
                        A generated interrupt hits the I/O MMU first, which
                        redirects it to the proper VM with the proper interrupt
                        vector.

                        In this approach, one VM runs a standard OS, and all

                        Type 2 hypervisors have an edge here: the OS upon which
                        they run can have device drivers for all sorts of
                        unusual I/O devices (3D printers, virtual reality

                        The authors contend that as VM matures, hardware
                        enhancements will allow guest OSs to access hardware
                        devices directly in a secure way.

                        We often can't directly assign a device to a VM. What
                        if we have 128 VMs on a server... we would need 128
                        network cards to directly assign a VM to each!

                        We can do this in software, but we may not be able to
                        take advantage of all of a device's advanced features,
                        because the software has no support for them. (The
                        tendency will be to support the common features among
                        various devices first.)

                        provides a solution in hardware. It is known as
                        <b>Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV)</b>,
                        by allowing SR-IOV devices to provide an independent
                        memory space, independent interrupts, and DMA streams
                        to each VM.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>PF (Physical Function):</b>
                        <br />
                        These allow the VM to configure the device directly,
                        however they see fit.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>VF (Virtual Function):</b>
                        <br />
                        These provide lightweight functions that trick a VM
                        into thinking it is sole owner of some device.
                        <br />
                        Some device hardware supports this: Intel I350 network
                        cards have 8 separate send and receive queues, which
                        provides hardware support for up to 8 VMs that think
                        this is their own card.
