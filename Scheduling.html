                        <li>A new processes is created (fork)
                        <li>When a process exits
                        <li>When a process blocks on I/O, on a semaphore, etc.
                        <li>When an I/O interrupt occurs. This may be a clock
                        interrupt.

                        blocked)? We need clock interrupts to do this.

                Policy Versus Mechanism
            </h2>

                <p>
                    The <b>mechanism</b> for scheduling may be in the
                    kernel, but the policy may be set by a user process
                    setting parameters, e.g., a parent may set its
                    children's priority level.
                </p>

            <h2>
                Thread Scheduling
            </h2>


                <p>
                    Usually, threads are scheduled at the user level.
                    <br>
                    No clock interrupt: must cooperate!
                    <br>
                    But everything is in a single process, so cooperation
                    should be easier than between processes.
                    <br>
                    It is good coding practice to <b>yield()</b>
                    occasionally.
                    <br>
                    But if threads behave badly, only <b>one</b> process
                    (the one containing those threads) is harmed. The OS
                    continues scheduling processes in general the same way
                    as always.
