                        This form of scheduling is annoying when a person with

                        before you, and you are only buying one item. You
                        wait a long time to check out, whereas if the system
                        has let you go first, the person with the full shopping
                        cart only would have been delayed a few seconds.

                        Each process only runs for a certain <b>quantum</b> of time,
                        and then is halted, and then the next process in a list

                        Setting the quantum correctly is the tricky bit: if it
                        is set to too small an amount of time, the system will
                        spend too much time swapping processes in and out of
                        being active. If the quantum is set too high, then a
                        crucial process may not get the CPU soon enough.

                        In an interactive system, the OS can try to estimate
                        which thing the user has clicked done, typed, etc.,
                        that will take the least time to run, and then run that

                        the other of which displays a list of files in the

                        We might guarantee each process an equal share of the
                        CPU time. We then choose which process to run based on
                        which one is the most "behind" in getting its
                        guaranteed share. It then runs until it passes at least
                        one other process in terms of getting its guaranteed
                        share. Then the OS switches to that process, since it
                        is now the one most behind.

                        This way, the low priority processes get the CPU, but
                        only in proportion to the number of lottery tickets
                        they "own." They will not have to wait forever if some

                    The <b>mechanism</b> for scheduling may be in the
                    kernel, but the <b>policy</b> may be set by a user process
                    setting parameters, e.g., a parent may set its
                    children's priority level.

                    <br>
                    This can be helpful if the parent process has information
                    about it's children that the OS lacks.

                    But if threads behave badly, only <b>one</b> process
                    (the one containing those threads) is harmed. The OS
                    continues scheduling processes in general the same way
                    as always.
