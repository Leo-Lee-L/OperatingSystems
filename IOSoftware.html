                Goals of the I/O Software
            </h2>

            	<ul>
            		<li>
            			A key concept in the design of I/O software 
                        is known as <b>device independence</b>.
                It means that I/O devices should be accessible to
                programs without specifying the device in advance.
            		</li>
            		<li>
            			<b>Uniform Naming</b>, simply be a string or 
                        an integer and not depend on the device in any way.
                In UNIX, all disks can be integrated in the file-system 
                hierarchy in arbitrary ways so the user need not be 
                aware of which name corresponds to which device. 
            		</li>
            		<li>
            			<b>Error Handling</b>: If the controller discovers 
                        a read error, it should try to correct the 
                        error itself if it can.
                If it cannot, then the device driver should handle it, 
                perhaps by just trying to read the block again.
                In many cases, error recovery can be done 
                transparently at a low level without the upper levels 
                even knowing about the error.
            		</li>
            		<li>
            			<b>Synchronous (blocking) and Asynchronous 
                            (interrupt-driven) transfers</b>: Most physical 
                        I/O is asynchronous, however, some very 
                        high-performance applications need to control 
                        all the details of the I/O, so some operating 
                        systems make asynchronous I/O available to them. 
            		</li>
            		<li>
            			<b>Buffering</b>: Often data that come off a device 
                        cannot be stored directly in their final destination.
            		</li>
            		<li>
            			<b>Sharable and Dedicated devices</b>: Some I/O devices, 
                        such as disks, can be used by many users at the same time.
                No problems are caused by multiple users having open 
                files on the same disk at the same time.
                Other devices, such as printers, have to be 
                dedicated to a single user until that user is finished.
                Then another user can have the printer.
                Introducing dedicated (unshared) devices also 
                introduces a variety of problems, such as deadlocks.
                Again, the operating system must be able to handle 
                both shared and dedicated devices in a way that avoids problems.

            <h2>
            	Programmed I/O
            </h2>

            <p>
            	This is one of the three fundamentally different ways 
                that I/O can be performed.
                The programmed I/O was the most simple type of 
                I/O technique for the exchanges of data or any 
                types of communication between the processor and the external devices.
                With programmed I/O, data are exchanged between 
                the processor and the I/O module.
                The processor executes a program that gives it direct 
                control of the I/O operation, including sensing device status, 
                sending a read or write command, and transferring the data.
                When the processor issues a command to the I/O module, 
                it must wait until the I/O operation is complete.
                If the processor is faster than the I/O module, 
                this is wasteful of processor time.
                The overall operation of the programmed I/O can be summaries as follow:
            	<ul>
            		<li>The processor is executing a program and encounters 
                        an instruction relating to I/O operation.</li>
            		<li>The processor then executes that instruction by issuing 
                        a command to the appropriate I/O module.</li>
            		<li>The I/O module will perform the requested action 
                        based on the I/O command issued by the processor 
                        (READ/WRITE) and set the appropriate bits in the 
                    I/O status register.</li>
            		<li>The processor will periodically check the status of the 
                        I/O module until it find that the operation is complete.</li>
            	</ul>
            </p>

                I/O module and external device, and an I/O command.
                There are four types of I/O commands that an 
                I/O module may receive when it is addressed by a processor:

            </h2>
            <p>
            	Interrupt driven I/O is an alternative scheme dealing with I/O.
                Interrupt I/O is a way of controlling input/output 
                activity whereby a peripheral or terminal that needs to 
                make or receive a data transfer sends a signal.
                This will cause a program interrupt to be set.
                At a time appropriate to the priority level of the I/O interrupt.
                Relative to the total interrupt system, the processors enter an interrupt service routine. 
            </p>

            <h3>
            	Interrupt I/O Inputs
            </h3>
            <p>
            	For input, the device interrupts the CPU when 
                new data has arrived and is ready to be retrieved 
                by the system processor.
                The actual actions to perform depend on whether 
                the device uses I/O ports or memory mapping.
            </p>

            <h3>
            	Interrupt I/O Outputs
            </h3>
            <p>
            	For output, the device delivers an interrupt either 
                when it is ready to accept new data or to acknowledge 
                a successful data transfer.
                Memory-mapped and DMA-capable devices usually generate 
                interrupts to tell the system they are done with the buffer.

            <h2>
            	I/O Using DMA
            </h2>
            <p>
            	Direct Memory Access is a technique for transferring data 
                within main memory and external device without 
                passing it through the CPU.
                DMA is a way to improve processor activity 
                and I/O transfer rate by taking-over the job of 
                transferring data from processor, and letting the 
                processor to do other tasks.
                This technique overcomes the drawbacks of other two 
                I/O techniques which are the time consuming process 
                when issuing a command for data transfer and tie-up 
                the processor in data transfer while the data processing is neglected.
                It is more efficient to use DMA method when large 
                volume of data has to be transferred.
                For DMA to be implemented, processor has to 
                share its' system bus with the DMA module.
                Therefore, the DMA module must use the bus only 
                when the processor does not need it, or it must 
                force the processor to suspend operation temporarily.
