            <h2>
                I/O Devices
            </h2>

            <p>
            	I/O devices can be roughly divided into two categories:
                block devices and character devices. 
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Block Devices</b> <br />
                        It stores information in fixed-size blocks, 
                        each one with its own address.
            Common block sizes range from 512 to 65,536 bytes. <br />
                        Examples are hard disks, Blu-ray discs, and 
                        USB sticks.
                
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Character Device</b> <br />
                    	It delivers or accepts a stream of characters, 
                        without regard to any block structure.
            Not addressable and does not have any seek operation. <br />
                    	Examples are printers, network interfaces, mice, 
                        and most other devices that are not disk-like 
                        can be seen as character devices.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Doesn't Really Fit</b>
                    <br />
                    Some devices don't fit into this division: For instance,
                    clocks aren't block addressable, nor do they accept
                    character streams. All they do is cause interrupts... at
                    timed intervals.
                    <br />
                    Memory-mapped screens do not fit this division either.

                Device Controllers
            </h2>
            <p>
            	The electronic component of I/O units is called the 
                device controller or adapter.
            Operating systems use device drivers to handle all I/O devices.
            There is a device controller and a device driver 
            for each device to communicate with the operating system.
            A device controller may be able to handle multiple devices.
            As an interface its main task is to convert serial 
            bit stream to block of bytes, 
            and perform error correction as necessary.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) Controller</b> <br />
                    	Older version of monitors that were bulky, 
                        power hungry and fragile!! CRT monitors fire a beam 
                        of electrons onto a fluorescent screen.
            Using magnetic fields, the system is able to bend the 
            beam and draw pixels on the screen. 
            <br />
            The first "laptops" weighed about 12 kilos.

                    <b>LCD Controller</b> <br />
                    	This works as a bit serial device at low level.
            It reads bytes containing the characters to be displayed from 
            memory and generates the signals to modify the polarization 
            of the backlight for the corresponding pixels in order 
            to write them on screen.
            <br />
            The presence of the controller means that the OS programmer does
            not need to explicitly program the electrial field of the screen!

            <p>
            The controller has registers (similar to CPU registers, but for the
            device) and the OS can write these registers to "give orders" to
            the device (e.g., "shut down" or "accept data") or read its state
            (e.g., "are you busy tonight?").

                    <br />
                    We use special I/O instructions like:
                    <br />
                    IN REG, PORT

                        The device is connected directly to certain

                        so that I/O device can transfer block of data to/from memory

                        Special I/O instructions require the OS to resort to
                        assembly code: IN and OUT cannot be executed in C or
                        C++.

                            <br />
                            We never detect when the device has changed state!
                            <br />
                            To fix this requires selective disabling of
                            caching.

                        <li>
                            All memory modules and all devices must examine
                            each memory reference to see if it is for them.
                            <br />
                            If there is a high-speed memory bus (as is typical
                            nowadays) then the I/O devices won't see the memory
                            addresses on the high-speed bus.
                            <br />
                            To fix this, we might send all requests to memory
                            and see if they fail, then send them to I/O
                            devices.
                            <br />
                            Or, we can "snoop" on memory requests and send
                            appropriate ones to I/O controllers. But they may
                            be slow!
                            <br />
                            Or we can assign some range of addresses as "not
                            real" memory. But these would not to be assigned at
                            boot time: no dynamic loading of devices!

            	To reduce the overhead of interrupts, DMA hardware 
                bypasses CPU to transfer data directly between I/O device and memory.
            DMA module itself controls exchange of data between 
            main memory and the I/O device.
            CPU is only involved at the beginning and end of 
            the transfer and interrupted only after entire block has been
            transferred,
            rather than a byte at a time.

                and arbitrates access to the system bus.
            It contains several registers that can be written and read by the CPU.
            These include a memory address register, a byte count 
            register, and one or more control registers.

                First the CPU programs the DMA controller 
                        by setting its registers so it knows what to transfer where
                </li>
            		<li>
                Alongside, DMAC issues a command to the disk controller 
                telling it to read data from the disk into its 
                internal buffer and verify the checksum.
            When valid data are in the disk controller's buffer, DMA can begin.
                </li>
            		<li>
                The DMA controller initiates the transfer by issuing 
                a read request over the bus to the disk controller
                </li>
            		<li>
                The write to memory is another standard bus cycle
                </li>
            		<li>
                When the write is complete, the disk controller sends 
                an acknowledgement signal to the DMA controller, also over the bus
                </li>
            		<li>
                The DMA controller then increments the memory address to 
                use and decrements the byte count.
            If the byte count is still greater than 0, steps 2 
            through 4 are repeated until the count reaches 0.
            At that time, the DMA controller interrupts the CPU to 
            let it know that the transfer is now complete.
                </li>
	            </ul>

            </p>
            <p>
            	DMA controllers vary considerably in their sophistication.
            The simplest ones handle one transfer at a time, whereas 
            sophisticated DMAC have multiple sets of registers 
            internally, one for each channel.
            Word transfer may be set up to use a round-robin algorithm, 
            or it may have a priority scheme design to favor some devices over others.
            Many buses can operate in two modes: <b>word-at-a-time mode</b> 
            and <b>block mode</b>.
            Some DMA controllers can also operate in either mode.
            In word-at-a-time mode, the DMA controller requests the 
            transfer of one word and gets it.
            If the CPU also wants the bus, it has to wait.
            The mechanism is called <b>cycle stealing</b> because 
            the device controller sneaks in and steals an occasional bus 
            cycle from the CPU once in a while, delaying it slightly.
            In block mode, the DMA controller tells the device 
            to acquire the bus, issue a series of transfers, then release the bus.
            This form of operation is called <b>burst mode</b>.
            It is more efficient than cycle stealing because acquiring the 
            bus takes time and multiple words can be transferred 
            for the price of one bus acquisition.
            The down side to burst mode is that it can block the CPU and 
            other devices for a substantial period if a long burst is being transferred.

            	Interrupts Revisited
            </h2>
            <p>
            	When an I/O device has finished the work given to it, 
                it causes an interrupt by asserting a signal on a bus 
                line that it has been assigned, signals that are 
                detected by the interrupt controller chip.
            If no other interrupts pending, the interrupt controller processes 
            the interrupt immediately.
            If another interrupt is in progress or there is a simultaneous 
            request on a higher-priority interrupt request line which it 
            continues to assert until serviced by the CPU.
            The controller puts a number on the address lines and 
            asserts a signal that interrupts the CPU.
            This number is used as an index into a table called 
            the <b>interrupt vector</b> to start a corresponding 
            interrupt service procedure.
            The service procedure in certain moment acknowledges the 
            interrupt by sending some value to some controller's 
            port which enables the controller to issue other interrupts.

            state is called a <b>precise interrupt</b> (Walker and Cragon, 1995).
            Such an interrupt has four properties:
            	<ul>
            		<li>
                The PC (Program Counter) is saved in a known place.
                </li>
            		<li>
                All instructions before the one pointed to by the PC have completed.
                </li>
            		<li>
                No instruction beyond the one pointed to by the PC has finished.
                </li>
            		<li>
                The execution state of the instruction pointed to by the PC is known.
                </li>
            	</ul>
            </p>
            <p>
				An interrupt that does not meet these requirements is called 
                an <b>imprecise</b> interrupt and makes life most 
                unpleasant for the operating system writer, who now has 
                to figure out what has happened and what still has to happen.
            </p>
            <p>
            Machines with imprecise interrupts typically vomit a large amount
            of internal state onto the stack to give the OS a chance to figure
            out what is up.
            </p>
            <p>
            Imprecise interrupts allow more of the CPU real estate to be used
            for cache, etc., but make the OS more complex.
