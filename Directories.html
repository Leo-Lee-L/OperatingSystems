			<b> Directories </b> or <b> Folders </b> are used by File Systems to keep track of files. Directories are files itself.

            <h3>
				Single-Level Directory Systems
            </h3>
			<p>
				In Single-Level Directory System, one directory contains all the files. This directory is sometimes called as a root directory. 
				<br/>
				<b>Example:</b>
				<br/>
				<div align="center">
				<img src="graphics/SingleHierarchy.png">
				</div>
			</p>
			</div>
			<h3>
				Hierarchical Directory Systems
            </h3>
			<p>
				When there are a large number of files, finding a single file in the directory would become very tough. Hence Hierarchical directory Systems are preferred when there
				are large number of files. This forms a tree of directories.
				<br/>
				<b>Example:</b>
				<div align="center">
				<img src="graphics/HierarchicalSystem.png" height="350" width="400">
				</div>
				
			</p>
			<h3>
				Path Names
            </h3>
			<p>
				When the file System is organized as a directory tree <b> Path Names </b> are used to specify the file names. 
				<br/>
				<ul>
					<li><b> Absolute Path Name: </b> It consists of the path name from the root directory to the file.Absolute path names always start at the root directory and 
					are unique. <br/><br/>
					<b>Example : </b><br/>
					<b> Windows: </b> \usr\ast\mailbox<br/>
					<b> UNIX: </b> /usr/ast/mailbox
					<br/>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;usr - root directory<br/>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ast - sub directory<br/>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mailbox - required File
					
					</li>
					<li><b> Relative Path Name: </b>A user can designate one directory as the current working directory, in which case all path names not beginning at the 
					root directory are taken relative to the working directory. Such path names which are relative to the working directory are called Relative Path Names.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<b>Example:</b> <br/>
					<b>Working Directory :</b> /usr/ast <br/>
					<b>Absolute Path Name:</b> /usr/ast/mailbox <br/>
					<b>Relative path Name:</b> mailbox
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Most of the Operating Systems that support a hierarchical directory system have two special entries in every directory. <b> "." </b> and <b> ".." </b> pronounced as "dot" 
				and "dotdot" respectively. Dot refers to the current directory; dotdot refers to its parent. 
			</p>
			<h3>
				Directory Operations
            </h3> 
			<p>
			Following are a set of system calls allowed for managing directories in UNIX operating System.
				<ul>
					<li><b>Create:</b>A directory is created</li>
					<li><b>Delete:</b>A directory is deleted</li>
					<li><b>Opendir</b>Directories can be read</li>
					<li><b>Closedir:</b>When a directory has been read it should be closed to free up internal table space.</li>
					<li><b>Readdir:</b>This system call returns the next entry in an open directory.</li>
					<li><b>Rename:</b>As Directories are also files, it can be renamed the same way files can be.</li>
					<li><b>Link:</b>This system call specifies an existing file and a path name, and creates a link from the existing file to the name specified by the path. This makes the
					file appear in more than one directory.<br/>This link is sometimes refered to as<b> Hard Link</b>, which just creates another file with a link to the same underlying node.</li>
					<li><b>Unlink:</b>A directory entry is removed. If a file is present in multiple directories then only the file in specified path is deleted.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<br/>
			<div>
			<p>
			<b>Symbolic Link :</b> A symbolic link is a link to another name in the file System. It can also be defined as the nickname for any file that contains a reference to another 
				file or directory in the form of an absolute or relative path and that affects pathname resolution. Also called a <b>Soft Link </b>.
