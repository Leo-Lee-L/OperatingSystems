                            <li>
                                Select that page for replacement which is going to be replaced the last i.e the page whose time to replacement is the longest.

                                This approach results in fewest page faults.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                However, this approach is not feasible, as we can never really know which page has the longest time to replacement.

                            <li>
                                This algorithm is just theory, it is not implementable.

                        Least Recently Used (LRU)

                            <li>
                                Select that page for replacement which has not been used for the longest time.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The approach relies on an assumption that the page which has not been used for the longest time is the least likely page
                                to be used in future.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                It has reasonably good performance.

                            <li>
                                The algorithm is difficult to implement as calculating page which has been used least recently used creates an overhead.

                                i.e Replace the page which has been in main memory the longest.

                                The algorithm is easy to implement.

                                This Algorithm behaves similar to LRU. Associate 'Use Bit' with each frame. When frame first loaded in main memory, use bit for
                                that frame set to 1.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                When page is subsequently referenced, use bit set to 1. Set of pages that are candidates for page
                                replacement form a circular buffer with pointer.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Pointer movies along circle when a page is needed for replacement. While moving, any page with use bit 1 , its use bit is set to 0.
                                The first page with use bit 0 is picked for replacement.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Its behaviour is similar to FIFO apart from the fact that it skips pages whose use bit is set to 1.
