				File System Implementation defines how files and directories are stored, how disk space is managed, and how to make everything work efficiently and reliably.

				File Systems are stored on disks. The above figure depicts a possible File-System Layout. 
				<ul>
				<li><b>MBR: </b> Master Boot Record is used to boot the computer </li>
				<li><b>Partition Table: </b> Partition table is present at the end of MBR. This table gives the starting and ending addresses of each partition. </li>
				<li><b>Boot Block: </b> When the computer is booted, the BIOS reads in and executes the MBR. The first thing the MBR program does is locate the active partition, 
				read in its first block, which is called the boot block, and execute it. The program in the boot block loads the operating system contained in that partition. Every 
				partition contains a boot block at the beginning though it does not contain a bootable operating system.</li>
				<li><b>Super Block: </b> It contains all the key parameters about the file system and is read into memory when the computer is booted or the file system is first
				touched.</li>
				</ul>
