                    <li>Can access any part of the machine.

            <h2>
                The Operating System as an Extended Machine
            </h2>

            <p>
                The textbook gives the following example:
            </p>

                <figure>

                <p>
                    It seems to me here that what the authors really mean by
                    "extended machine" is "abstract machine." They say as much
                    here:
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    The job of the operating system is to create good
                    abstractions and then implement and manage the abstract
                    objects thus created. In this book, we will talk a lot
                    about abstractions. They are one of the keys to
                    understanding operating systems.

                    <b>Crucial</b>: "The operating systems real customers are
                    the application programs (via the application programmers,
                    of course)."
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It is the relationship between the operating system and the
                    application programs that our textbook focuses on, and that
                    we will focus on in this course.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And that relationship is why you should care about this
                    course: most of you will never write an operating system.
                    But in your work as application programmers you will work
                    with an operating system, and use its services. To be a master
                    application programmer, you must understand the services
                    you are using.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Furthermore:</b> oftentimes, applications themselves
                    must do some of the jobs an operating system usually does.
                    Knowing how an operating system with millions of users has
                    solved a problem can be a great guide as to how you, as an
                    application programmer, should solve it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Personal example:</b> caching theoretical values for
                    stock options: the system we built was much like a paging
                    system for virtual memory.

            <h2>
                The Operating System as Resource Manager
            </h2>

                <p>
                    The previous section gives a top-down view. The bottom-up
                    view is that the OS manages access to the CPU, disks,
                    displays, printers, mice, memory, and so on by the various
                    applications running on the system.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Imagine three programs printing at once with no OS,
                    one printing "Hello world," one printing "Namaste,"
                    and one printing "Ni hao."
                    The printer might print out something like:
                    <br>
                    "HNNeaillm haorasowosrtled"
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Obviously, this is not what we want to have happen!
                    The OS must manage the printer resource, so that
                    applications can acccess it in an orderly manner.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The OS should share resources across both time and space:
                    each app must get its own time with the printer, but may
                    divide up memory at any single point in time.
                </p>
