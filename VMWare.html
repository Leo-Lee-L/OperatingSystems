                    Challenges in Bringing Virtualization to the x86
                </summary>
    
                <p>
                    Hypervisors <b>add a level of indirection</b> to the domain
                    of computer hardware. They provide the abstraction of a
                    <b>virtual machine</b>: each one thinks if is "king of the
                    hill," and has a whole machine to itself. Ideally, the VMs
                    should be just like the emulated machine, as fast as the
                    emulated machine, and completely isolated from each other.
                    <br />
                    VMware:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Compatibility:</b>
                        <br />
                        Any x86 OS, and all of its applications, should be able
                        to run on without modifications on the VM.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Performance:</b>
                        <br />
                        The overhead of the hypervisor had to be low enough the
                        users could use a VM as their primary machine.
                        <br />
                        Ideally, things run as fast as on a native OS, but at
                        least as fast as the previous chip generation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Isolation:</b>
                        <br />
                        The hypervisor had to ensure complete isolation of each
                        VM, i.e., be completely in charge of the real physical
                        resources. A VM might be infected with malicious code:
                        this will not impact any other VM.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    There was tension between the requirements. E.g., total
                    compatibility might need to be sacrificed for performance.
                    But the designers held isolation as paramount.
                    <br />
                    The primary challenges were:

                        <br />
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>The x86 architecture was of daunting complexity.</b>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>x86 machines had diverse peripherals.</b>
                        <br />

                            ESX uses a file system (VMFS) optimized to store
                            virtual machine images. A single ESX Server can
                            issue over 1 million disk operations per second.

                            capabilities. For example, it introduced VMotion,
                            which could live migrate a VM from one box running
                            ESX Server to another. This required the
                            coordination of the memory manager, the CPU
                            scheduler, and the networking stack.
