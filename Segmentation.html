                Virtual Memory
            </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The Virtual memory discussed so far consisted of virtual addresses going from 0 to some maximum address, i.e there was a
                        single consolidated address space.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For many problems, having more than one address spaces is a much better solution.
                        Consider an example where the compiler procedure call stack grows and shrinks with
                        time but has been allocated contiguous virtual memory addresses.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We need for the program to be free of worries involving the contraction and shrinking of tables storing variables in a way which is similar
                        to how virtual memory handles the problem by dividing it into overlays.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A general solution for this is to divide the virtual memory space into completely independent address spaces called <b>segments.</b>
                        Every segment consists of a linear address space starting from 0 to some maximum. <br>
                        The maximum may vary for each segment as segments may have variable lengths.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Because each segment constitutes a different address space, the segment may grow or shrink independently without affecting each other.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                Pure Segmentation

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Segmentation differs from paging in a very essential way. Page sizes are fixed and are allocated frames which are also of the same fixed sized.
                    On the other hand, the basic premise of segmentation says that segment sizes are variable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Every process is divided into a number of chunks where each chunk is called a <b>segment</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Each process is loaded by bringing all of its segments onto main memory.
                    Every segment of the process is loaded ont the main memory by creating partitions dynamically matching the size of each segment.
                    This creates an exact fit for every segment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Segmentation is free of internal fragmentation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Suffers from external fragmentation but not as much, because process is divided into segments which are smaller in size.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Every program/process may occupy more than one non contagious segments, similar to dynamic partitioning.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Consider a case where if a larger segment is evicted and a segment which is smaller is put in its place.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As the new segment is smaller it leaves an area in the segment which remains unused. This is called external fragmentation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The 'holes' created by external fragmentation are dealt with by implementing a process called 'compaction'. This is a costly process with a large overhead
                    and hence must not be called very often.
                </li>
