                <li>Figure out how to list running processes on your computer.
                    (ps -ef will do it on UNIX-based computers.) How many
                    processes are running?
                    <br>
                    Choose ten of them, for which you have no clue what they
                    are doing. Figure out what it is they do!
                <li>Record every computer you encounter for an entire day.
                    Remember:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your laptop, desktop, etc.
                        <li>Smart phone, tablet, watch
                        <li>Web sites you visit
                        <li>ATM machine
                        <li>Credit card with a chip
                        <li>Cable settop box
                        <li>Computer that says when the next subway train is
                            coming
                        <li>How do you enter NYU?
                        <li>Computer in taxicab
                        <li>Cash register (CVS!)
                        <li>Microwave
                        <li>More?
                    </ul>
                    Try to determine what operating system each computer you
                    encounter is running. (Some you might not be able to
                    discover!)
