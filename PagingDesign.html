            <p> Consider the case where all processes want more memory. In such a case the processor would need to remove one or more processes from
                memory. <br>
                <b> Load Control is deployed to achieve the target, i.e to remove one or more processes from memory in order to fulfill the memory requirement
                of another process.</b></p>
