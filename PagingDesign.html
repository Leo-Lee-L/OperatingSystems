                Load Control
            </h2>

            <p> Consider the case where all processes want more memory.
                In such a case the processor would need to remove one or more processes from
                memory. <br><br>

                <b> Load Control is deployed to achieve the target,
                    i.e to remove one or more processes from memory in order
                    to fulfill the memory requirement
                    of another process.</b></p>
