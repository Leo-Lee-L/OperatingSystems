            <p>
                There is never enough memory to actively hold all code and data structures needed by running processes in memory at any given point of time.
                The idea is to swap in and out blocks of code as they are required from secondary memory.

            </p>

                    <p>
                        Every time a process is swapped in or out, it must be correctly located and referenced in order to continue from its
                        previously active state.

                        Programs in other processes must be forbidden from referencing memory locations of a given process without valid permissions.

                    <b>Fixed Partitioning</b> <br>
                    <p>
                        Main memory is divided into static partitions.
                        Any process, given its requirements may be loaded into a partition of equal or greater size. <br>
                        Note that here processes are not divided into modules,  rather memory is divided and entire processes are placed
                        inside a partition.<br><br>

                        Partitions may be of two types :
                        <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Equal Sized</b><br>
                        <p> If program size is beyond that of the partition size, need overlays</p>
                        <p> Gives rise to internal fragmentation</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Unequal Sized</b><br>
                        <p> Fit into smallest possible partition</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <li>
                    <b>Dynamic Partitioning</b>  <br>
                    <p>
                        Here, partitions are created dynamically as per the requirement/size of the process in question.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Partition created to be exact fit for asking process size. No Internal fragmentation.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                When processes are pulled out, it creates holes in memory space. This causes external fragmentation.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Need to perform a process known as compaction to regularly shift partitions and remove holes created by processes leaving
                                main memory. This is a costly process and cannot be done repeatedly.
                            </li>

                                Main Memory is divided into equal sized partitions. Each partition is called a <b>frame</b>.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Processes are divided into equal sized chunks where each chunk is called a <b>page</b>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                To load a process, all of its pages are loaded into frames which need not be contagious.
                                The OS takes care of the order of execution.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Operating System maintains a page table for each process which contains the frame location for each page.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Paging causes zero internal fragmentation and is optimal among static partitioning techniques.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Paging causes minimal external fragmentation.
                            </li>

                    <b>Simple Segmentation</b> <br>

                        <ul>

                                Every process is divided into a number of chunks where each chunk is called a <b>segment</b>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Each process is loaded by bringing all of its segments onto main memory.
                                Every segment of the process is loaded ont the main memory by creating partitions dynamically matching the size of each segment.
                                This creates an exact fit for every segment.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Segmentation is free of internal fragmentation.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Suffers from external fragmentation but not as much, because process is divided into segments which are smaller in size.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Every program/process may occupy more than one non contagious segments, similar to dynamic partitioning.
