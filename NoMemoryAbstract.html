                History
            </h2>

        <p> <b>The Simplest memory abstraction is no abstraction at all.</b></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                    Early Computers did not have any memory 
                    abstraction at all. Which means, all 
                    programs had access to physical memory.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This means we could not have 2 programs running in main memory at once,
                        as this would cause inconsistency in data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Processes could erase each others' written output/input and cause severe inconsistencies.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <h2>
                Multiprogramming without memory abstraction
            </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                It is possible to run multiple programs without having memory abstraction.
            </li>
            <li>
                The idea is to have just one running process in main memory at any point of time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whenever a process leaves main memory, all of its current state and values are copied
                onto main memory and another process is brought onto main memory.

            </li>
            <li>
                Whenever the process returns to main memory, all of the saved contents
                are brought back to main memory.
            </li>
        </ul>

                Multiprogramming without memory abstraction and swapping
            </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    With addition of special hardware, it is possible to run multiprogramming without swapping.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Early models of IBM 360 followed this approach:<br><br>

                    Memory was divided into 2 KB bloks and each block was assigned a 4-bit protetion key
                    held in special registers inside the CPU.<br><br>

                    A machine with 1 MB memory needed only 512 of these 4 bit registers for a total
                    of 256 bytes of key storage.<br><br>

                    The PSW (Program Status Word) also contained a 4-bit key.<br><br>

                    The 360 hardware trapped any attempt by a running process to access memory
                    with a protection code from the PSW key.<br><br>

                    Only the OS is permitted to change the protection keys, hence,
                    user processes could not interfere with one another and also with the OS process.
