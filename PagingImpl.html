                       Resident Set Size defined how much of a process is in main memory

                    <li>
                        How much main memory do we give to a process i,e what should its resident set size be.

                Replacement Scope

                    <li>
                        What is the set of potential replacements to choose from
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the assigned memory to every process is small, the probability
                        of the processor finding another ready process in main memory
                        increases.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If number of pages of a process in main memory are less, then
                        probability of page fault for that process will increase.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Adding memory to a process is not always useful, after a certain
                        point we need good page replacement algorithms and better
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Could use fixed allocation determined at initial load time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Variable allocation wins long term, as it balances the load by
                        allocating more frames to the processes that are faulting more often.
                    </li>
                </ul>
