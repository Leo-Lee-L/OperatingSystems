                    <b>Simple Segmentation</b><br>
                    <br> Every process is divided into number of segments of
                        potentially different sizes and loaded onto main memory by
                        creating dynamic partitions which need not be contagious. <br><br>
                        Hence, Logical Address is now (segment number, offset)<br><br>
                        This offers a solution with no internal fragmentation.</br>

                <li>
                    <b>Simple Paging</b><br>
                    <br> Every process is divided into number of 'pages' of
                        equal size and loaded onto main memory which is itself
                        divided into partitions called 'frames'.
                        Size of a page is the same as size of a frame.
                        As a result, there is no internal fragmentation.<br><br>
                        Hence, Logical Address is now (page number, offset)<br><br>
                        Page table information is used to calculate (frame number, offset).

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Logical Addresses are dynamically translated to physical
                        addresses at runtime.<br><br>
                        This means that a page can occupy different
                        areas of main memory at different times.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Process pages are not contagiously located in main memory.<br><br>
                        Logical address to physical address translation is of utmost
                        importance at runtime using Page Table.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                    <b> HENCE, It is NOT necessary that all the
                        pages are in main memory during process execution.</b>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                    <b> If, for the time being, the next
                        page/segment to be executed is in main memory,
                        then execution can proceed.</b><br><br>

        <h3> Working of Virtual memory</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b> Resident Set</b><br>
                <br>    Resident Set is the portion of the process which is in main memory.<br>
                    <br> If processor encounters a logical address which is not in main memory:
                    <ul>
                  <li>
                      It generates an interrupt which indicates a memory access fault.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Interrupted process is put in blocked state and
                      Operating System takes control.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Disk I/O request is issued to bring into main memory
                      the page whose logical address caused a fault.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Once disk I/O interrupt is issued, the OS takes control
                      and resumes the process which threw an interrupt.
                  </li>
            </ul>

            </li>

            <li>
                <b> Page Table Structure</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Page Table becomes more complex than what
                        it is in Simple Paging.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bit 'P' indicates the presence of the page in main memory.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If P is flagged as true, then frame number of that
                        page is also present.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Modify bit 'M' indicates whether contents of that page have been
                        altered since it was last loaded into main memory.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If M is flagged as false, then no need to write out the page
                        when it is replaced in the frame it is occupying in main memory
                    </li>
                </ul>


            </li>

            <li>
                <b> Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) </b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Each Virtual memory Reference can cause 2 physical address
                        lookups viz. the page table entry and the actual data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        TLB provides a solution to this by providing a high speed
                        cache storing page table entries.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Given a virtual address, the processor will first examine the TLB
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If TLB contains the physical address, then page is loaded, else,
                        page is loaded from main memory and also stored in TLB for future use.
                        If page is not present in both TLB and main memory, then page fault occurs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        TLB contains both page number as well as complete page table entry.
                    </li>
                </ul>
