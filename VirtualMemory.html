                    <b>Simple Segmentation</b><br>
                    <p> Every process is divided into number of segments of potentially different sizes and loaded onto main memory by
                        creating dynamic partitions which need not be contagious. <br>
                    Hence, Logical Address is now (segment number, offset)<br>
                    This offers a solution with no internal fragmentation.</p>

                <li>
                    <b>Simple Paging</b><br>
                    <p> Every process is divided into number of 'pages' of equal size and loaded onto main memory which is itself divided into partitions
                        called 'frames'. Size of a page is the same as size of a frame. As a result, there is no internal fragmentation.<br>
                    Hence, Logical Address is now (page number, offset)<br>
                        Page table information is used to calculate (frame number, offset).

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p> Logical Addresses are dynamically translated to physical addresses at runtime.<br>
                        This means that a page can occupy different areas of main memory at different times.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p> Process pages are not contagiously located in main memory.<br>
                        Logical address to physical address translation is of utmost importance at runtime using Page Table.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                    <b> <p>HENCE, It is NOT necessary that all the 
                        pages are in main memory during process execution.</p></b>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                    <b><p> If, for the time being, the next 
                        page/segment to be executed is in main memory,
                        then execution can proceed.</b>
                        <br> This is the idea of <b>VIRTUAL MEMORY.</p></b>

        <h3> Working of Virtual memory</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b> Resident Set</b>
                <br><p> Resident Set is the portion of the process which is in main memory.
                    <br> If processor encounters a logical address which is not in main memory:
                    <ul>
                  <li>
                      It generates an interrupt which indicates a memory access fault.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Interrupted process is put in blocked state and Operating System takes control.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Disk I/O request is issued to bring into main memory the page whose logical address caused a fault.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Once disk I/O interrupt is issued, the OS takes control and resumes the process which threw an interrupt.
                  </li>
            </ul></p>

            </li>

                <b> Page Table Structure</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Page Table becomes more complex than what it is in Simple Paging.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bit 'P' indicates the presence of the page in main memory.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If P is flagged as true, then frame number of that page is also present.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Modify bit 'M' indicates whether contents of that page have been altered since it was last loaded into main memory.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If M is flagged as false, then no need to write out the page when it is replaced in the frame it is occupying in main memory
                    </li>
                </ul>


            </li>

            <li>
                <b> Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) </b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Each Virtual memory Reference can cause 2 physical address lookups viz. the page table entry and the actual data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        TLB provides a solution to this by providing a high speed cache storing page table entries.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Given a virtual address, the processor will first examine the TLB
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If TLB contains the physical address, then page is loaded, else, page is loaded from main memory and also stored in TLB for future use.
                        If page is not present in both TLB and main memory, then page fault occurs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        TLB contains both page number as well as complete page table entry.
                    </li>
                </ul>
