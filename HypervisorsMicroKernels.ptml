                    With <b>paravirtualization</b>, the hypervisor in effect acts
                    like a microkernel, and the guest OSs are like modules running
                    on top of it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    They make <b>hypercalls</b> into the hypervisor,
                    instead of the hypervisor trying to emulate difficult hardware
                    instructions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Of course, this means the guest OS <i>knows</i>
                    it is a guest and a special version of it must be run.
                    </li>
