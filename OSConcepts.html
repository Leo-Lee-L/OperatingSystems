            <h2>
                Processes
            </h2>

                <p>
                    A process is "a program in execution." It has an address
                    space, and a set of resources to which it has access, such
                    as files, registers, related processes, and more, and other
                    program information. A process is the set of all of this
                    information necessary to run a program.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While I am lecturing, your laptop has several processes
                    running: you have an editor in which your are ostensibly
                    taking notes on my lecture, your Facebook page, in which
                    your are posting pictures of your winter break, and a chat
                    window, in which you are typing to your (possible)
                    significant other. The operating system must keep each of
                    these processes running, as well as background processes
                    that might be fetching emails, or upgrading your word
                    processor.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The operating system provides calls that deal with the
                    creation and termination of processes. Generally, a new
                    process is created as a sub-process of an existing one.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Processes are associated with particular users who started
                    them, and with groups the user belongs to. There is often a
                    specially privileged user: in UNIX, it is the
                    <b>superuser</b>, and in Windows, the <b>administrator</b>.
                    In <i>The Matrix</i>, he is called <b>Neo</b>.

                Address Spaces

                <p>
                Two purposes:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Protect programs from stomping on each other's memory.
                    <li>Extend the memory available to a single program: the
                        address space may be <i>larger</i> than the machine's
                        physical memory.
                </ol>

            <h2>
                Files 
            </h2>
                <p>
                    The <b>file system</b> hides the messiness of disk, CD,
                    cloud drive, memory stick, etc. details from the
                    application programs: they can just write and read files
                    from a location in the file system hirarchy.
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="graphics/Hierarchy.png">
                    <figcaption>

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    A good file system allows <i>mounting</i> of devices at a
                    certain point in the directory structure. So, for instance,
                    a memory stick could be mounted as /memstick. Furthermore,
                    <b>special files</b> can be mounted at places in the file
                    system to allow programs to treat printers, modems, and
                    other devices as files.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Finally, <b>pipes</b> are a sort of pseudo-file, used to
                    connect the output of one program to the input of another.
                </p>

            <h2>
                Input/Output
            </h2>

                <p>
                    Obviously, it is vital that computers be able to accept
                    input from humans and show humans their output. Some of
                    this can be dealt with by files, as above. But in many
                    cases, as with a graphical display or a mouse,
                    files are not a good abstraction for dealing with these devices.
                    Operating systems provide services like <b>device drivers</b> to
                    deal with these situations.
                </p>

            <h2>
                Protection
            </h2>

                <p>
                    People often want to protect the information they put on
                    computers from competitors, foreign governments, Russian
                    hackers, disgruntled ex-spouses, their boss, and so on.
                    Operating systems typically provide some form of
                    protection.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Simple example:</b> UNIX protection sets owner, group
                    and other read, write, and execute bits on every file. For
                    example:
                    <br>
                    <b>rwxr-xr--</b>
                    <br>
                    means that the owner of the file can read, write and
                    execute (run) it, the owner's group members can read an
                    execute it, and all other system users can only read it.

                Ontogeny Recapitulates Phylogeny
            </h2>

                <p>
                    Frankly, I think the authors could have done without the
                    Darwinian reference here, since this principle
                    <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recapitulation_theory#Modern_status">

                    </a>
                    But their point that computer technologies may be "dead" at
                    one point in time but "alive" at another is sound. They
                    give the example of CPU caches: so long as the on-board CPU
                    memory can be accessed much faster than RAM, we will have
                    caches. If RAM technology speeds up significantly, they may
                    disappear. But if the CPU jumps ahead again, they will make
                    a comeback. It is important to understand <i>history</i>,
                    and why certain concepts fell out of favor, and why they
                    might come back into favor.
